# ExiledInstaller-FanMade (Doesn't work, because I stopped working on it :/)
A pretty simple installer for [Exiled](https://github.com/galaxy119/SamplePlugin), a SMOD Like Development Framework for the game [SCP-SL](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laboratory/). This just builds on top of the previous installer, and that's it.

# How do you use it?
It's really simple, just run it and it will ask you where to install it. Put the managed path in it, and then press enter. It works its magic!

# Arguments for the EXE
Simply one.
## Install Path
This is the managed folder. This is the simplest one you can find. It's in the dedicated server's files.

Use it like this:
`ExiledInstaller.exe "F:\Steam\steamapps\common\SCP Secret Laboratory Dedicated Server\SCPSL_Data\Managed"`
