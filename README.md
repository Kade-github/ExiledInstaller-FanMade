# ExiledInstaller-FanMade
A pretty simple installer for [Exiled](https://github.com/galaxy119/SamplePlugin), a SMOD Like Development Framework for the game [SCP-SL](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laboratory/). This just builds on top of the previous installer, and that's it.

# Arguments for the EXE
Simply one.
## Install Path
This is the managed folder. This is the simplest one you can find. It's in the dedicated server's files.

Use it like this:
`ExiledInstaller.exe "F:\Steam\steamapps\common\SCP Secret Laboratory Dedicated Server\SCPSL_Data\Managed"`
